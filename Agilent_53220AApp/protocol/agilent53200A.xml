                  operations. The "method" attribute controls the underlying method by which the new value is communicated, 
				  currently only "GCV" for reads (use DCOM exposed getControlValue()) and "SCV" for sets (use DCOM exposed setControlValue()) 
				  are supported. The meaning and use of the extint attribute has been covered earlier.
